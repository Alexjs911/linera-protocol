# Auditing

The goal of this milestone is to provide a data format similar to a blockchain.

## Requirements

* Data format for the "tree of chains" is specified.

* Data can be explored (eventually through a web interface ?).

* Certificates can be verified.

* The set of validators who contributed to a certificate is visible.

* "Execution" of user commands can be replayed to verify the chains.

* "Validation" of user commands can be challenged (requesting additional "received certificates").
