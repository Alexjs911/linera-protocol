# Auditing

The goal of this milestone is to provide a data format similar to a blockchain for
auditors and new validators to utilize.

## Requirements

* Data format for the "tree of chains" is fully specified.

* Certificate can be verified and execution replayed to validate the chains.

* Data can be explored (eventually through a web interface ?).
